Open network intelligence is a Python UI project that creates artificial intelligence in penetrating
testing machines that we use in everyday life. Problems, bugs, vulnerabilities, and threats are sorted
out by this AI. The advantage of this project is to not call any cyber security or ethical hackers every
time to find bugs or vulnerabilities in our network either LAN or WAN. A common man without any
computer science knowledge can use this AI to rectify his system or to recover his system from any
vulnerability or malware. Whenever ONI runs on a network it uses ARP scans to discover live hosts
and uses network scans to find all open ports and services. The AI will recognize and do some
auxiliary scans on that particular machine that uses a specific port eg. FTP. The project is designed in
a way that every port will have a separate algorithm to penetrate and find vulnerabilities. If the
vulnerabilities found in the specific target machine match that one in our cloud database(Which
consists of all vulnerabilities details CVE) then it will alert the user. The reports for all types of scans
are generated and the final summary is also given. If the system is more vulnerable (based on
physical or hardware) this program, may recommend calling cyber security or sending a message to
the server (which I am hosting) the community of ethical hackers will receive a message then hiring
can be done. The AI is designed in two ways for the client users either in Text mode or With Voice
mode with a speech recognition program with help of gTTs.
